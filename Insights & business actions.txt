🔹 STEP 10 — Business Insights & Actionable Recommendations

This step answers one question:

“So what should the company DO differently because of this model?”

If you can’t answer that, the model is just math.

1️⃣ Reconfirm the FINAL MODEL (clear and explicit)
Final prediction model

Logistic Regression

Why (one-liner):

Highest recall for churners

Best ROC-AUC

Interpretable

Stable and production-friendly

This decision is already justified. Don’t reopen it.

2️⃣ Extract TOP CHURN DRIVERS (FROM BOTH MODELS)

We already discussed how to extract them.
Now we interpret them like a business.

From Logistic Regression coefficients + Random Forest importance, the consistent drivers are:

🔑 Key churn drivers (example list)

Low tenure

Month-to-month contracts

High MonthlyCharges

Lack of TechSupport / OnlineSecurity

Fiber optic internet users

Electronic check payment method

The exact ranking may vary slightly — consistency matters more than order.

3️⃣ Translate MODEL OUTPUT → BUSINESS LANGUAGE
❌ Bad (technical)

“Tenure has a coefficient of −1.2”

✅ Good (business)

“New customers are significantly more likely to churn than long-term customers.”

This translation is mandatory.

4️⃣ BUSINESS INSIGHTS (WRITE THEM LIKE THIS)
🧠 Insight 1 — New customers churn early

Evidence:

Tenure is one of the strongest churn predictors

Interpretation:

Customers in their first few months are at highest risk

Business action:

Improve onboarding

Proactive support in first 90 days

Early engagement campaigns

🧠 Insight 2 — Month-to-month contracts drive churn

Evidence:

Month-to-month customers churn far more than long-term contracts

Interpretation:

Customers without commitment are easier to lose

Business action:

Incentivize 1-year / 2-year plans

Discounts or bundled offers

Contract upgrade nudges for high-risk users

🧠 Insight 3 — High prices increase churn risk

Evidence:

MonthlyCharges positively associated with churn

Interpretation:

Price sensitivity is a major churn driver

Business action:

Loyalty discounts

Personalized pricing offers

Review high-cost plans with low perceived value

🧠 Insight 4 — Support services reduce churn

Evidence:

TechSupport & OnlineSecurity reduce churn probability

Interpretation:

Customers with support feel more “locked in” and satisfied

Business action:

Bundle support services

Free trial of TechSupport

Upsell security features to high-risk users

🧠 Insight 5 — Fiber users churn more

Evidence:

Fiber optic customers show higher churn risk

Interpretation:

Possibly higher expectations, pricing, or service quality issues

Business action:

Improve fiber service reliability

Dedicated fiber customer support

Targeted satisfaction surveys

5️⃣ TURN INSIGHTS INTO A CLEAN TABLE (RECRUITERS LOVE THIS)
Insight	Business Action
New customers churn early	Improve onboarding & first-90-day engagement
Month-to-month contracts churn more	Offer long-term plan incentives
High monthly charges increase churn	Loyalty discounts & pricing review
Support services reduce churn	Bundle or upsell TechSupport
Fiber users churn more	Improve fiber service & support

This table is pure gold.

6️⃣ HOW THE MODEL WOULD BE USED IN REAL LIFE

Explain this clearly (no ML jargon):

Customer data is fed into the model

Model outputs churn probability

Customers are grouped:

Low risk (<30%)

Medium risk (30–60%)

High risk (>60%)

Retention actions are triggered based on risk

This shows end-to-end thinking.

7️⃣ METRIC INTERPRETATION (BUSINESS VERSION)

You should be able to say:

“The model identifies ~80% of customers who are likely to churn. While some non-churners may be contacted unnecessarily, this trade-off is acceptable because the cost of losing a customer is significantly higher.”

That sentence = maturity.
